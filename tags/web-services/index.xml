      <description>Little boxes on the hillside&amp;hellip;  My current company is undergoing a transition to microservices. This is a new challenge for the company since, until this point, all our processes and tooling revolve around a monolith, shaped by all the decisions we made in the past (the good ones and the bad ones).
The way we decided to start is by migrating one single component into a microservice, and laying down a “golden path” for other services to follow.</description>

      <description>Source: http://sarahrussellpottery.com/galleries/clocks/  In a previous article, we discussed the dispatching system we use at Glovo to find the best courier to deliver each order.
To recap, we have a service named Jarvis. Every few seconds, Jarvis retrieves the current state of the city and makes a series of decisions based on mathematical models and optimisation algorithms. We can think of it as N tasks running periodically, where N is the number of cities.</description>

      <title>Meaningful web service /health checks</title>

      <description>About 10 years ago, I deployed my first web service. It was a nice, silly PHP application to store game cheat sheets. Interestingly, what made me really proud about it was the fact that I was able to release new versions with a single command, with a weird mix of git hooks and rsync-powered bash scripts.
When I think about the massive transformation that our field has undergone in the last few years in terms of continuous delivery and service orchestration, I always come back to that memory, and I can&amp;rsquo;t help laughing a bit.</description>

      <description>At Glovo, we have one vision: Connecting our customers to their cities. We do that by facilitating access to different services (like restaurants, supermarkets, and other stores) through a single mobile application and a fleet of independent couriers.
 Anything you want. Delivered in minutes.
 Of course, that is easier said than done. Behind the scenes, there are hundreds of factors that affect the experience of our customers and couriers.</description>

      <description>About 3 years ago, our startup pivoted from a Q&amp;amp;A app for doctors to an education platform (which we named SchoolHouse.io). It was a big product shift, and we knew many technical changes would follow.
At the time, we had a 1-year-old Python+Django codebase that was already getting rusty and hard to maintain. How did we cross the legacy line so fast?
(sigh)
We were clearly doing something wrong, and we wanted to understand what, so we made a list of our main pain points:</description>
