      <description>Little boxes on the hillside&amp;hellip;  My current company is undergoing a transition to microservices. This is a new challenge for the company since, until this point, all our processes and tooling revolve around a monolith, shaped by all the decisions we made in the past (the good ones and the bad ones).
The way we decided to start is by migrating one single component into a microservice, and laying down a “golden path” for other services to follow.</description>

      <description>Around 2015, @hecrj and I were having serious trouble maintaining a Django codebase we had started just one year ago!
We knew we were doing something wrong, and we had serious doubts about MVC as a healthy, long-term architecture for complex applications.
After doing some research and debating a few ideas, we decided to ditch frameworks and experiment with our own system, drawing inspiration from many other patterns we liked, such as the Hexagonal Architecture, Event Sourcing, CQRS, Domain-Driven Design.</description>
