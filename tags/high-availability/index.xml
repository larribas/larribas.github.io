      <description>Source: http://sarahrussellpottery.com/galleries/clocks/  In a previous article, we discussed the dispatching system we use at Glovo to find the best courier to deliver each order.
To recap, we have a service named Jarvis. Every few seconds, Jarvis retrieves the current state of the city and makes a series of decisions based on mathematical models and optimisation algorithms. We can think of it as N tasks running periodically, where N is the number of cities.</description>

      <description>At Glovo, we have one vision: Connecting our customers to their cities. We do that by facilitating access to different services (like restaurants, supermarkets, and other stores) through a single mobile application and a fleet of independent couriers.
 Anything you want. Delivered in minutes.
 Of course, that is easier said than done. Behind the scenes, there are hundreds of factors that affect the experience of our customers and couriers.</description>
