      <description>This is the first in a series of articles where @hecrj and I share what we have learned after working on a large, fast-changing codebase for the past 3 years, and being perfectly happy with the result!
If you are a web developer, you are probably used to having new frameworks, libraries and technologies come out every other week.
 We are on a never-ending quest to find better tools and patterns, but does that mean our code is doomed to become old and wrinkly?</description>

      <description>I am one of the co-founders of SchoolHouse.io, an ed-tech startup that&amp;rsquo;s been on production since late 2016 and now helps hundreds of teachers provide a better experience to their students.
On the technical side, we are a 2-person team (@hecrj and I) who take care of the full stack, from graphical design to deployment and infrastructure monitoring.
Main challenges  Building interactive presentations in real time with WebSocket.</description>

      <description>Around 2015, @hecrj and I were having serious trouble maintaining a Django codebase we had started just one year ago!
We knew we were doing something wrong, and we had serious doubts about MVC as a healthy, long-term architecture for complex applications.
After doing some research and debating a few ideas, we decided to ditch frameworks and experiment with our own system, drawing inspiration from many other patterns we liked, such as the Hexagonal Architecture, Event Sourcing, CQRS, Domain-Driven Design.</description>

      <description>Cualy is a side project I developed and tried to sell in late 2017. The idea behind it is to enable businesses to improve their quality control over products that are not closely monitored (such as vending machines, gym equipment, public spaces, public bikes&amp;hellip;).
Businesses can generate and print stickers with NFC + QR for their products and keep track of them via a simple backoffice.
Main challenges  Making the most lightweight and fast page I could so that users could give feedback almost instantly on any connection.</description>

      <description>I developed SandCapsule together with @hecrj back in early 2017 mainly for fun and to give Elm and Haskell (two pure functional languages) a test run (before deciding if we would use them in a more serious project). At first we released it for ourselves, and since then we&amp;rsquo;ve used it to surprise some of our friends and loved ones, make predictions of some games or TV shows, and to send our friends silly messages.</description>
