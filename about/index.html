            <p>I&rsquo;m Lorenzo Arribas, a Software Engineer based in Barcelona, Spain.</p>
<p>Over the past 7 years, I have worked in 2 hypergrowth start-ups and seen them turn into well-established multi-national companies. I&rsquo;ve also ventured into creating my own company for a couple of years.</p>
<p>I like fast-paced environments where I can have an impact and feel like every day is challenging. I try not to stay within my comfort zone. During the last 7 years I&rsquo;ve put frontend applications into production, developed event-driven microservices and set up complex infrastructure topologies.</p>
<p>From time to time, I also post my thoughts and projects on <a href="/posts/">my blog</a>.</p>
<p>Some of my last projects have involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Migrating a critical backend service to a highly available, distributed system. <a href="/posts/migrating-glovos-dispatching-service-from-a-single-machine-to-a-distributed-system/">1</a></li>
<li>Adopting Continuous Delivery on a monolith with 70+ concurrent engineers and going from 1 to 15 deployments per day.</li>
<li>Deploying Machine Learning projects at scale, with 1M online inferences per hour.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m always open to hearing about new opportunities or projects. If you think I can be a good fit, don&rsquo;t hesitate to <a href="mailto:contact@larribas.me">drop me an email</a>.</p>
